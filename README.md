# [libcsuit](https://github.com/yuichitk/libcsuit/)
**libcsuit** is a C library for encoding and decoding [IETF SUIT manifests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-suit-manifest).
The manifest contains meta-data about the firmware image. The manifest is protected against modification and provides information
about the software/firmware author.

For more information on how the IETF SUIT manifest is used to protect firmware updates of IoT devices, please look at the
 [IETF SUIT architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-architecture) document and the
 [IETF SUIT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/suit/about/) working group.

## Overview

This implementation uses
 - the [QCBOR](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR) library for encoding and decoding CBOR structures,
 - the [t_cose](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/t_cose) library for cryptographic processing of COSE structures,
 - OpenSSL or Mbed TLS (based on the PSA Crypto API) for cryptographic algorithms.

This implementation offers a subset of the functionality defined in [draft-ietf-suit-manifest-19](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-suit-manifest-19).

Example programs are offered for testing.

## Getting started

This library uses two build systems, namely cmake and classical makefiles.
To build with makefile you can use docker environment and we recommend you to use it.

### Using Docker(RECOMMENDED)

Currently the example codes require some features which corresponding cryptographic library packages (such as libssl-dev or libmbedtls-dev in Debian) do not contain.
If you download their latest and stable version of source code and build it, your building environment might changed.
Preventing this, we recommend you to build libcsuit examples with docker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuichitk/libcsuit
cd ./libcsuit
```

**(a) Use OpenSSL**
```
docker build -t libcsuit_ossl -f ossl3.Dockerfile .
docker run -t libcsuit_ossl
```

**(b) Use Mbed TLS**
```
docker build -t libcsuit_psa -f psa.Dockerfile .
docker run -t libcsuit_psa
```

**(b) Firmware Encryption with Mbed TLS**
```
docker build -t libcsuit_enc -f enc.Dockerfile .
docker run -t libcsuit_enc
```

### Using Makefiles

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yuichitk/libcsuit
cd ./libcsuit/QCBOR
make install
cd ../t_cose
make -f Makefile.ossl install
```

Make and run sample codes you need.

- suit_manifest_parser (extract values and print it, and then re-generate the same binary)
```bash
make -f Makefile.parser test
```

- suit_manifest_encoder (generate a manifest)
```bash
make -f Makefile.encode test
# generates ./testfiles/suit_manifest_expX.cbor
```

- suit_manifest_process (extract values and call appropriate callbacks)
```bash
make -f Makefile.process test
```

To install libcsuit.a use the following command:
```
make install
```

To install libcsuit.so use the following command:
```
make install_so
```

To generate Doxygen document use the following command:
```
make doc
```
and open `html/index.html`.

### Using CMake

The cmake file allows building code for OpenSSL and for Mbed TLS based on a parameter passed to cmake.
If you decide to use OpenSSL then you need to download and install it before building this library.
The OpenSSL library and the include files need to be included in the search path.

First, create a directory for the entire project. Inside this directory put the code of qcbor, t_cose,
mbedtls (if used), and libcsuit.

Here are the commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR.git
git clone https://github.com/laurencelundblade/t_cose.git
git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls.git
cd mbedtls
make generated_files
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/yuichitk/libcsuit.git
cd libcsuit
```

Next, build the code using cmake

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DMBEDTLS=1 ..
make 
```

If you want to build the code for OpenSSL then omit the '-DMBEDTLS=1' parameter from the cmake invocation.
